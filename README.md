# Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game

## Introduction

This is the 3rd project for Udacity’s FEND Nanodegree. The assignment is to build a clone of the classic Frogger Arcade game. To win the game, the player must travel from one end of the  board to the other. There will be obstacles in the way, so the player must avoid the ‘enemies’ to reach the finish point.

## How to Play

Fork, clone or download this repo. You'll be able to the see the board when you open index.html in your favorite browser. To move the player, use the up, down, left, and right keys on your keyboard. Once you make it to the other side of the board, you'll get a success message.
